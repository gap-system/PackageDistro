      "Abstract": "\n                The <Package>DifSets</Package> Package implements an algorithm\n                for enumerating all difference sets up to equivalence in an\n                arbitrary finite group. The algorithm functions by finding\n                difference sums, which are potential images of difference sets\n                in quotient groups of the original group, and searching their\n                preimages. In this way, the search space can be dramatically\n                decreased, and searches of groups of relatively large order\n                (such as order 64 or order 96) can be completed.\n            ",
