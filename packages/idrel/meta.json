      "Abstract": "&IdRel; is a &GAP; package originally implemented in 1999, using the &GAP; 3 language, when the first author was studying for a Ph.D. in Bangor.\n<P/>\nThis package is designed to compute a minimal set of generators for the module of the identities among relators of a group presentation.\nIt does this using\n<List>\n<Item>\nrewriting and logged rewriting: a self-contained implementation of the Knuth-Bendix process using the monoid presentation associated to the group presentation;\n</Item>\n<Item>\nmonoid polynomials: an implementation of the monoid ring;\n</Item>\n<Item>\nmodule polynomials: an implementation of the right module over this monoid generated by the relators.\n</Item>\n<Item>\nY-sequences: used as a <E>rewriting</E> way of representing elements of a free crossed module (products of conjugates of group relators and inverse relators).\n</Item>\n</List>\n<P/>\n&idrel; became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015.\n<P/>\nBug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome.\nPlease contact the last author at <Email>cdwensley.maths@btinternet.com</Email> or submit an issue at the GitHub repository <URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/idrel/issues/</URL>.\n",
