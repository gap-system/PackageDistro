McDermott for the discovery that the group\ndiscussed in Section&nbsp;<Ref Label=\"sec:ThompsonsGroupV\"/> is\nisomorphic to Thompson's Group V in July 2008, and to Laurent Bartholdi\nfor his hint on how to construct wreath products of residue-class-wise\naffine groups with&nbsp;(&ZZ;,+) in April 2006.\nFurther, I thank Bettina&nbsp;Eick for communicating this package\nand for her valuable suggestions on its manual in the time before its\nfirst public release in April 2005.\nLast but not least I thank the two anonymous referees for their\nconstructive criticism and their helpful suggestions.\n        ",
