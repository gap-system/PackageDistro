      "Abstract": "\n             This document explains the primary uses of the &SCO;\n             package. Included in this manual is a documented list of\n             the most important methods and functions you will\n             need. For the theoretical basis of this package please\n             refer to my diploma thesis and the corresponding paper\n             (work in progress; <Cite Key=\"Goe\"/>).\n                    ",
      "Acknowledgements": "\n             The &SCO; package would not have been possible\n             without the theoretical work by I. Moerdijk and D. A. Pronk\n             concerning  simplicial cohomology of orbifolds <Cite\n             Key=\"mps\"/>. Many thanks to these two, as well as Mohamed Barakat\n             and the Lehrstuhl B für Mathematik at RWTH Aachen University in\n             general. It should be noted that &SCO; in its current functionality\n             is dependent on the &GAP; package &homalg; by M. Barakat <Cite\n             Key=\"homalg-package\"/>, as it relies on &homalg; to do the actual\n             computations. This manual was created with the help of the &GAPDoc;\n             package by M. Neunhöffer and F. Lübeck.\n               ",
