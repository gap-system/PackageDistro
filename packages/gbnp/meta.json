      "Abstract": "\nWe provide algorithms, written in the <Package>GAP</Package> 4 programming\nlanguage, for computing Gröbner bases of non-commutative polynomials, and some\nvariations, such as a weighted and truncated version and a tracing facility.\nIn addition, there are algorithms for analyzing the quotient of a\nnon-commutative polynomial algebra by a 2-sided ideal generated by a set of\npolynomials whose Gröbner basis has been determined and for computing quotient\nmodules of free modules over quotient algebras.\n<P/>\nThe notion of algorithm is interpreted loosely: in general one cannot expect a\nnon-commutative Gröbner basis algorithm to terminate, as it would imply\nsolvability of the word problem for finitely presented (semi)groups.\n<P/>\nThis documentation gives a short description of the mathematical content,\nexplains the functions of the package, and provides more than twenty worked\nout examples.\n",

Green <Cite Key=\"Green1997\"/>.</Item>\n<Item>From Version 0.8.3 on the package has three additional files\n    (<File>fincheck.g</File>, <File>tree.g</File> <File>graphs.g</File>) with\n    routines for finding the Hilbert function and testing finite dimensionality\n    when given a Gröbner basis by Chris Krook <Cite Key=\"Krook2003\"/>, based on\n    work by Victor Ufnarovski <Cite Key=\"MR91d:16053\"/>.</Item>\n<Item>From Version 0.9 on the package is enriched with support for fields\n    implemented in GAP and additional prefix rules for quotient modules, as\n    well as some speed improvements by Jan Willem Knopper. Knopper has also\n    formatted the documentation in GAPDoc <Cite Key=\"GAPDoc\"/>. </Item>\n<Item>From Version 1.0 on the package is extended with NMO (for Noncommutative\n    Monomial Orderings) by Randall Cone. This enables the GBNP user to choose\n    a wider selection of monomial orderings than the standard one built into\n    GBNP itself. Documentation on NMO can be found in the NMO manual <Cite\n    Key=\"NMODoc\"/>. </Item>\n</List>\n",
