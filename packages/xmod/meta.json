      "Abstract": "The &XMod; package provides functions for computation with\n<List>\n  <Item>\n  finite crossed modules of groups and cat1-groups, \n  and morphisms of these structures; \n  </Item>\n  <Item>\n  finite pre-crossed modules, pre-cat1-groups,   and their Peiffer quotients;\n  </Item>\n  <Item>\n  isoclinism classes of groups and crossed modules; \n  </Item>\n  <Item>\n  derivations of crossed modules and sections of cat1-groups; \n  </Item>\n  <Item>\n  crossed squares and their morphisms,   including the actor crossed square of a crossed module; \n  </Item>\n  <Item>\n  crossed modules of finite groupoids (experimental version). \n  </Item>\n</List>\n<P/>\n&XMod; was originally implemented in 1996 using the &GAP;3 language, when the second author was studying for a Ph.D. <Cite Key='A1'/> in the School of Mathematics and Computer Science at Bangor University.\n<P/>\nIn April 2002 the first and third parts were converted to &GAP;4, the pre-structures were added, and version 2.001 was released. \nThe final two parts, covering derivations, sections and actors, were included in the January 2004 release 2.002 for &GAP; 4.4.\n<P/>\nIn October 2015 functions for computing isoclinism classes of crossed modules, written by Alper Odaba&#x15f; and Enver Uslu, were added.\nThese are contained in Chapter <Ref Chap='chap-isclnc' />, and are described in detail in the paper <Cite Key='IOU1' />.\n<P/>\nBug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome. To provide these, please submit an issue at <URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/xmod/issues/</URL> or send an email to the first author at <Email>cdwensley@btinternet.com</Email>. \n<P/>\n",
