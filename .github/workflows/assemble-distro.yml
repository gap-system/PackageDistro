#
# This workflow is invoked when new changes are pushed to the `main` branch,
# or when new tags are created. It then assembles the package distribution
# tarballs, and uploads them to the given tag, or (in the case of pushes to
# `main`) to the tag `latest`; the `latest` tag then is also changed to point
# to the new HEAD of `main`.
#
# The purpose of this is that on the one hand, for a GAP releases such as
# 4.12.0, the corresponding package distribution is fixed and available from a
# matching tag, e.g. `v4.12.0`. On the other hand, for daily testing of GAP
# development versions and the package distribution, the `latest` tag can be
# used to get a snapshot of the package distribution as it is at the moment.
