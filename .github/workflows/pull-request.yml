#
# This workflow is run for pull requests the modify the `packages` directory.
# It works in two stages: first it determines the list of added, modified or
# removed packages; for each added or modified package, it executes the
# `validate_package.py` script to check for issues with the metadata or
# tarball. Provided these initial tests pass, the second stage consists of
# invoking a separate workflow which runs tests for all packages in the
# package distribution as they would appear when the PR under review would be
# merged. This is used to determine whether any package tests change from PASS
# to FAIl or vice versa.
