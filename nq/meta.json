      "Acknowledgements": "            The author of ANU NQ is Werner Nickel.                        <P/>The development of this program was started while the            author was supported by an Australian National University PhD            scholarship and an Overseas Postgraduate Research Scholarship.                        <P/>Further development of this program was done with support from the            DFG-Schwerpunkt-Projekt \"`Algorithmische Zahlentheorie und Algebra\"'.                        <P/>Since then, maintenance of ANU NQ has been taken over by Max Horn. All            credit for creating ANU NQ still goes to Werner Nickel as sole author.            However, bug reports and other  inquiries should be sent to Max  Horn.                        <P/>The following are the original acknowledgements by Werner Nickel.                        <P/>Over the years a number of people have made useful suggestions            that found their way into the code:  Mike Newman, Michael            Vaughan-Lee, Joachim Neubüser, Charles Sims.                        <P/>Thanks to Volkmar Felsch and Joachim Neubüser for their careful            examination of the package prior to its release for GAP 4.                        <P/>This documentation was prepared with the <Package>GAPDoc</Package>            package by Frank Lübeck and Max Neunhöffer.",
