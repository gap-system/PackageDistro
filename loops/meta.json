      "Acknowledgements": "\nWe thank the following people for sending us remarks and comments, and\nfor suggesting new functionality of the package: Muniru Asiru, Bjoern\nAssmann, Andreas Distler, Ale&#353; Dr&#225;pal, Graham Ellis, Steve\nFlammia, Kenneth W. Johnson, Michael K. Kinyon, Alexander Konovalov,\nFrank L&#252;beck, Jonathan D.H. Smith, David Stanovsk&#253; and Glen\nWhitney.\n\n<P/>The library of Moufang loops of order 243 was generated from data\nprovided by Michael C. Slattery and Ashley L. Zenisek. The library of\nright conjugacy closed loops of order less than 28 was generated from\ndata provided by Katharina Artic. The library of right Bruck loops of\norder 27, 81 was obtained jointly with Izabella Stuhl.\n\n<P/>Gábor P. Nagy was supported by OTKA grants F042959 and T043758, and\nPetr Vojtěchovský was supported by the 2006 and 2016 University of\nDenver PROF grants and the Simons Foundation Collaboration Grant 210176.\n",
